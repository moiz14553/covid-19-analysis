# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

The COVID-19 pandemic reshaped the world, and data was key to understanding its impact. Using Python and various data analysis libraries, I conducted an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 trends and vaccination progress to extract meaningful insights.

## üîç Key Insights & Visualizations

- **Time-Series Analysis**: Line plots revealed infection peaks and recovery trends.
- **State-wise Impact**: Heatmaps and bar charts highlighted COVID-19 hotspots.
- **Active Cases Trend**: Area plots tracked case fluctuations over time.
- **Vaccination Progress**: Pie charts and line graphs showed vaccine distribution and its impact.
- **Top 10 Affected States**: Bar plots with log scales provided a comparative view.

## üõ† Tools & Skills

- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Data Wrangling & EDA**
- **Statistical Analysis**
- **Interactive Visualizations**
